# Project Guidelines

- When submitting pull requests, always include the user's original query in the PR body.
- Do not rely on workflow variables or environment variables to pass the query to other scripts.
- Before running the project's tests, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  to ensure modules like `discord.py` are available.
